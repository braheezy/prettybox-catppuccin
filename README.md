# prettybox-catppuccin
This project provides a pre-provisioned VM to show off various [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) ports.

Basically, each port/tool/app is installed and then the Catppuccin theme is applied to it per the theme's instructions. It's slightly opinionated, especially if I use the port in my daily life

# Why?
I like automating things and I like Catppuccin. This grew over time into the project it is today. I hope to add as many ports as possible, meaning different desktops, WMs, OSes.
